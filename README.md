To see the demo in action, go [here](https://electronicarts.github.io/pbmpm/).

This **Main** branch contains many optimizations that make it harder to understand. For a more accessible version of the code, see the [SIGGRAPH 2024](https://github.com/electronicarts/pbmpm/tree/siggraph2024) branch that is less optimized but more readable.

## Building

PB-MPM is based on WebGPU. Currently, this means that among desktop browsers, **Firefox will not work**.
Some mobile hardware can run WebGPU but this app is not properly mobile-aware so the experience will not be good.

1. [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/). If you are on *MacOS*: Please follow [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/). 
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `jekyll serve --livereload`
4. Open a browser window at [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)
